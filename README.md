# Advent of Code - Python

This repo tracks my journey through the Advent of Code competition.
All challenges are solved with Python.

I will try to post solutions for 2020 challenges, then port/solve previous year ones.
This is not usually (-> never) the code I used to solve each problem, just a refactored version to clean up messy stuff.

## Requirements
TBD

## Howto
TBD
